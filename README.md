# Deep Learning with Tensorflow and Keras


Deep learning is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. 
Deep learning models can recognize complex patterns in pictures, text, sounds, and other data to produce accurate insights and predictions.

There are 60,000, 32x32 color images from these 10 classes, with 6000 images from each class. The training dataset contains 50,000 training images and the test dataset contains 10,000 test images.
The CIFAR-10 dataset images are of color images with a (32 x 32) resolution. All the images in the dataset are of shape (32,32,3) where 3 represents the number of channels i.e R-G-B (Red,Green & Blue).
This dataset is used in many types of deep learning research for object recognition.
